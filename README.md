The NUBOMEDIA Marketplace provides an easy way for managing and downloading NUBOMEDIA applications from a central point.
This allows users to share applications easily among the community that can be launched with a few clicks without making any adoptions.

The Marketplace provides an RESTful API for uploading, updating, downloading and deleting applications to/from the marketplace.

## Application's json example

This section shows how an Application's json is structured and what the meaning of the parameters is.

    "name":"awesomeApplication",
    "description":"This application is just awesome",
    "provider":"FOKUS",
    "shared":true,
    "requirements":{
        "req1":"1",

    },
    "projectName":"NUBOMEDIA",
    "gitURL":"https://github.com/nubomedia/nubomedia-magic-mirror.git",

# What is NUBOMEDIA

This project is part of [NUBOMEDIA], which is an open source cloud Platform as a
Service (PaaS) which makes possible to integrate Real Time Communications (RTC)
and multimedia through advanced media processing capabilities. The aim of
NUBOMEDIA is to democratize multimedia technologies helping all developers to
include advanced multimedia capabilities into their Web and smartphone
applications in a simple, direct and fast manner. To accomplish that objective,
NUBOMEDIA provides a set of APIs that try to abstract all the low level details
of service deployment, management, and exploitation allowing applications to
transparently scale and adapt to the required load while preserving QoS
guarantees.
